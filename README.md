# sync_n_syncy
if we want to establish communication between arduino and python program,then pyserial is the one we use..
There may occur synchronization error between them. Arduino might not receive the desired data sent from the python programme..
So, In this code, i have used software and hardware interrupts to establish the synchronization between them.
